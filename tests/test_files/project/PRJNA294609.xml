        <TITLE>Optimized sgRNA design to maximize activity and minimize off-target effects for genetic screens with
            CRISPR-Cas9 raw sequence reads
        </TITLE>
        <DESCRIPTION>CRISPR technology has proven to be a powerful means of conducting genetic screens. The ease of
            programming the Cas9 protein with an sgRNA presents an abundance of potential target sites for each gene,
            but the on-target activity and off-target effects of individual sgRNAs can vary. Here, we incorporated
            recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, performed positive and
            negative selection screens, and observed that the use of these rules greatly enhances the consistency and
            depth of screening results. Additionally, we profiled the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and
            developed a metric to predict off-target sites that outperforms existing metrics. We combine these findings
            from large-scale, empirical data to improve our computational design rules and create highly-optimized sgRNA
            libraries that maximize on-target activity and minimize off-target effects in order to enable more effective
            and efficient genetic screens and genome engineering.
